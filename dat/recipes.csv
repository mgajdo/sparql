as you've seen from my other recipes i like things simple, easy, and use common ingredients for a great taste.  sometimes i’ll add garlic powder, cream cheese and/or parmesan cheese to make an alfredo sauce.  

unfortunately i don’t have the exact measurements of the add-ins because i usually make the sauce to taste for the meal.  i would recommend stirring in your extra ingredients very small amounts and let the sauce steep.  the milk will hide the flavors of your extra ingredients at first and will take time to work through the mixture.

for best results always use real butter or a butter blend that is at least half butter.","['butter', 'flour', 'salt', 'milk']"
